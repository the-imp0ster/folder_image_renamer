# ˚ · .Numerical Image Renamer (Python)

### ˚ · .This is a simple program that will dive into a specified directory and rename any images found into a numerical order. 

This might not seem like a serious problem, but I found it very helpful to rename my image files this way when generating images using layers, as I often store the used layer combinations in an array to avoid creating duplicates, and this numerical renaming usually makes the arrays much easier to read and troubleshoot if the layers don't end up stacking right.



## ˚ · .Running the Image Renamer

To run the image renamer, provide the program with the directory containing the image files you wish to rename, using directory_path.

Navigate to a terminal and run the following command:
python image_rename.py

˚ · . The program will inform you when the renaming is complete.
